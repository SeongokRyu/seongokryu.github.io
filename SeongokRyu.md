### Profile {#profile}

Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in the department of chemistry at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). 
At the beginning of my Ph.D course, I studied quantum chemistry and participated to develop a quantum chemistry package, ‘ACE-Molecule’. ACE-Molecule performs quantum chemistry calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and post Hartree-Fock by using real-space grid basis. 
I implemented a geometry optimization module and a super-sampling method.

In recent days, I have studied to develop computational models based on deep neural networks for molecular applications. 
In this field, molecules are usually digitized by graph structure and limited amount of labeled data is usually given. 
Therefore, considering such situation, my research interest has been focused on graph neural networks, generative models of molecules, Bayesian deep learning and data-efficient statistical learning algorithms.
