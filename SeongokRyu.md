### Profile {#profile}

Developed quantum chemistry package, ACE-Molecule at the beginning of the graduate school.

Drug discovery using deep learning, currently.

------

### Research Interest {#research_interest}

* Graph Neural Network
  : Graph neural network is the most suitable deep learning architecture for molecular science.

* Uncertainty Analysis
  : Prediction of molecular properties with uncertainty analysis, we can be more confident in drug discovery.
 
* Drug Discovery
  : Overall skills is applied to design drug _in silico_. Hope to take current drug discovery strategies to the next step.
