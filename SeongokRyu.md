### Profile {#profile}

Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in the department of chemistry at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). At the beginning of the graduate school, I studied quantum chemistry and am one of the developer of quantum chemistry package, ‘ACE-Molecule’. ACE-Molecule performs density functional theory (DFT) and post Hartree-Fock calculations with using real-space grid basis. I implemented geometry optimization and super-sampling method which accelerates calculations.

In recent days, I have been attracted to applications of deep learning on various field. Especially, I have developed deep learning models for drug discovery from supervised learning model to generative models. In order for our models to be realized in real-life drug discovery, I studied approaches to train tasks with few data, uncertainty assessment for AI-safety and conditional generative models for de novo designs of target candidates. I believe what I have studied can contribute not only on molecular applications, but also on other fields.

### Research Interest {#research_interest}

* Graph Neural Network
  : Graph neural network is one of the most suitable deep neural network architecutre for molecular science.

* Bayesian Deep Learning
  : Knowing what we don't know about our data and model is as important as development of deep learnikng model itself. For this purpose, I have studied Bayesian Deep Learning to apply uncertainty estimation methods on my research topics.
  
* Learning Tasks with Few Data
  : In most of the real-life case, unfortunately, it is hard to obtain a large amount of data. Lack of data is very common and critical problem in drug discovery related applications. To tackle such problems, I have interested in topics such as transfer learning and meta learning.
  
* Generative Models and Data Embedding
  : Even though screening molecules from molecular libraries have been successfully adopted, finding the most desired candidates from the library is like finding a needls in a haystack. To design molecules, not to discovery, deep generative models have been developed. Especially, I think that deep latent variable models have been promising for molecualr applications.
 
* Applications of Deep Learning for Drug Discovery
  : Have been applying overall skills to design drug _in silico_. Our group have developed various models to realize drug discovery from _in silico_ to _in real-life_.
