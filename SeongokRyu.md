### Profile {#profile}

Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in the department of chemistry at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). At the beginning of the graduate school, I studied quantum chemistry and am one of the developer of quantum chemistry package, ‘ACE-Molecule’. ACE-Molecule performs density functional theory (DFT) and post Hartree-Fock calculations with using real-space grid basis. I implemented geometry optimization and super-sampling method which accelerates calculations.

In recent days, I am completely attracted to Deep Learning - especially graph neural network and Bayesian neural network. Graph neural network is suitable for molecular applications because molecules can be represented in graph structures. I developed models to understand how graph neural networks learn molecular science, and applied GNN for efficient drug discovery. Moreover, I hope uncertainty analysis using Bayesian statistics will make us confident in using the neural networks.
