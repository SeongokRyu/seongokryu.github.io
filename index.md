### Profile {#profile}

Hi, I am a Research scientist working for AITRICS. I am managing the team that develops machine learning systems accelerate drug discovery processes. 
Our team has strong skills on graph neural networks, Bayesian deep learning, and deep generative models, all of those are evidentaly necessary for developing AIs in drug discovery. 
We have been developing various prediction systems across bio-activity, toxicity, and ADME properties, which allows reliable predictions via Bayesian learning algorithms.
