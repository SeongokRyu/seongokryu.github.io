Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in the department of chemistry at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). At the beginning of the graduate school, I studied quantum chemistry and am one of the developer of quantum chemistry package, 'ACE-Molecule'. ACE-Molecule performs density functional theory (DFT) and post Hartree-Fock calculations with using real-space grid basis. I implemented geometry optimization and super-sampling method which accelerates calculations.

Recently, I am completely attracted to Deep Learning, and develop models to design drug using DL. Especially, I am interested in graph neural network and bayesian neural network. Eventually, I hope to take current drug development to the next level and to achieve this based on a deep understanding of AI theories.
